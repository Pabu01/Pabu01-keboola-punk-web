					<p>Firehouse Subs, the 11th fastest growing franchise of 2015 according to Entrepreneur Magazine, was looking to put the power of data into the hands of their franchisees. Instead of looking to the top for the information their goal was to provide each of their 1000+ franchisee owners with insights into their own operations and overall performance to better manage their businesses. </p>

					<ul class="normal-list">
						<li><strong>Sales, surveys and reviews data at one report</strong></li>
						<li><strong>1000+ franchises and same data</strong></li>
						<li><strong>How do I benchmark with others ?</strong></li>

				<p>After selecting the GoodData platform, Firehouse Subs partnered with Keboola Vancouver to create an analytics platform, called Station Pulse, just for this purpose. Powered by Keboola Connection (KBC), Keboola Vancouver was able to take data from several sources such as sales, surveys and reviews and put all the information in one easily accessible place. Firehouse Subs not only recognized the need to centralize data, but also the value of adding third party applications such as elastic search for keyword detection and weather augmentation to enrich that data being presented to each local franchise.
				</p>

					<p>
					Now franchisees have 24/7 access to review their restaurant(s) data and an understanding of how to use this tool to monitor their overall health and performance.  By doing things like keeping an eye on sales and sales KPIs, benchmarking KPI’s against other restaurants and noticing correlations to things like the weather and community donations, franchisee owners can now use the data given to them to run the most successful business possible.

					<p>Cross Media, an award winning communications planning and full service media agency, was looking to provide greater transparency and insights into their marketing decisions for their clients. Their main challenges were how to collect data more efficiently and how to then integrate previously siloed information so that the client’s understood the impact of Cross Media’s branding decisions.</p>

					<ul class="normal-list">
						<li><strong>Siloed information into one report</strong></li>
						<li><strong>Communicate the impact of branding decissions with data</strong></li>
						<li><strong>Get away from data manipulations in excel </strong></li>

			<div class="desc-half-list">
				<p>Inside Cross Media’s core competency of transparency is Marketing Intelligence, which includes data-driven strategies supported equally by reporting and analysis. Until Keboola Connection (KBC), this was largely a labour intensive process filled with manual data collection and manipulations through Excel. The introduction of KBC automated both the collection process and transformation of data to streamline reporting via the GoodData platform. Not only did this increase their clients’ access to campaign data, but the marketers (Crossmedians) themselves are now able to reallocate their time from the redundant tasks to activities with the most value like analysis and planning.
				</p>

					<p>
					As with many agencies, information was siloed based on organizational divisions like department and account. With each team collecting from different sources (Facebook, Twitter etc.) as well as using their own unique naming conventions data became unusable for reporting purposes. Keboola Vancouver’s Consultants worked with Cross Media to understand the relationships between data and developed data collection best practices in order to improve data integrity.
