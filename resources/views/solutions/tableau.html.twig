					<p>When planning a new product launch and deciding where to spend your marketing budget, you probably have questions regarding the impact of your campaign:</p>

					<ul class="normal-list">
						<li><strong>How long it will take to turn marketing leads into faithful customers?</strong></li>
						<li><strong>Did I target the correct customer group?</strong></li>
						<li><strong>Do my potential customers respond to the advertisement as expected?</strong></li>
						<li><strong>What is the return of on investment for my campaign based on different target groups and products?</strong></li>
					</ul>

					<br>


					<p> Our clients have asked these and other inspired questions which you can check out <a href="http://wiki.keboola.com/home/keboola-environment/sales"> here.</a><BR>

					What we have discovered is that by combining these question with an analytical mindset, you can  create the reports your company needs to invest in better marketing decisions and generate a higher return on investment. </p>

					<p>Automated data <STRONG>blending</STRONG> and <STRONG>enrichment</STRONG> for Tableau is a breeze with Keboola Connection. Use KBC’s transformation engine to join streams from both <STRONG>on-premise</STRONG> and <STRONG>cloud</STRONG> data sources. The Tableau integration allows automatic distribution of TDE extract files to desktops or servers or creates database connection for on-demand data pulls.</p>
					<p>Because KBC does all the heavy lifting, Tableau receives the data in optimal form that allows you to maximize the value of all the great Tableau features.</p>
					<p>A fully <STRONG>Cloud based </STRONG> solution, KBC does not depend on local computing power. This further reduces your infrastructure need for a Tableau-crowned data stack.
					The <STRONG>SQL</STRONG> and <STRONG>R</STRONG> based transformation engine allows analysts like yourself to use the knowledge you already have to avoid the steep learning curve of competing ETL solutions. The built-in secure storage eliminates the need for separate database or DWH solution.</p>
