					<p>When starting a new campaign, you may have experienced the thrill of the situation, when your campaign managed to hit and introduce thousands of users in the early stages of your sales funnel, but you are still uncertain how many will hit the end of the funnel where they are supposed to actually pay.</p>
					<p>In these cases it may be useful to track the performances of your campaigns and to track whether your users are behaving as you expect. In the case shown below our client was tracking  how many free SIM Cards sent on demand were activated weeks after the delivery.</p>

					<p>Betting on one single marketing type may be tricky. Typically you may have experienced that incomes from commercial mailing lists may wither away as reclamations or failed payments or otherwise unfinished transactions may increase over time. On the other hand other not so much apparent sources with greater brand impact may give you significant  incomes over time that may go unnoticed from a short perspective.</p>
