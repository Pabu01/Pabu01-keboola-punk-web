				<p>While going through this process, H1.cz
					decided to take the opportunity to bring
					more detailed and faster data to its employees,
					elevating its practise of data-driven
					operational management. While migrating
					their reporting and project management
					systems, the agency needed to hold on to its
					old know-how, as well as data exported from
					older data systems. In the world of agency business, the level of
					speed and amount of detail available to
					employees is a crucial determining factor
					between profit and loss. All employees
					require information regarding KPIs, consultants,
					billed time, budgets, etc. While implementation
					of the new CRM was taking longer
					than anticipated, the management had only
					partial information about its
				</p>

					<p>
					business and was unable to distinguish which projects and
					people were generating profits or losses, and
					when. Additionally, it was dificult to recognize
					the organization’s operational management
					properly. H1.cz management realized they needed a
						universal reporting tool which would allow an
						easy access to the data from their old CRM.-
						This would allow H1.cz connections to things
						like: their new CRM, specialized tools for
						advertisement management, analytics as well
						as time-tracking tools such as Toggl,
						accounting, etc. Integrating data sources during ongoing
						scheduling presented a big challenge, leading
						them to make Keboola Connection their
						ultimate choice. Keboola Connection writes
						user-ready data into GoodData in the first
						stage of its process.

				<h1>Hero Story</h1>
				<div class="desc-half-list">
					<p>Without extensive system analytical knowledge
						or heavy support from IT, SEO Department
						head Tomas Vyskocil was able to use
						agile methods and, within just three months,
						change the daily operations of the company,
						by integrating, cleaning and transforming all
						data sources into usable dashboards. These</p>
					<p>
					dashboards are now in use across the organisation
					on a daily basis, and serve as the basis
					for making fast and appropriate decisions. Due to these actions, this system has
						received widespread support, won many
						internal advocates, and is spreading from
						internal use towards client-oriented use.</p>

				<h1>Results</h1>
				<div class="desc-half-list">
					<p>"I really like to see people being able to
						retrieve very complicated information on
						their own within a couple of clicks. What
						would historically mean sending a request to
						finance and waiting a week or two to get
						some spreadsheet is now available to everyone
						with just a couple of clicks on nicely
						understandable dashboards. We have managed to cancel more than 95%
						of spreadsheets used for daily management.
						Now we consume the data directly in the
						form of reports and dashboards that we can
						actually much more easily query."</p>

					<p>"So first, we
						have the data straight away; second, it is
						more understandable when presented in
						graphical form; and, finally, we can actually
						form a hypothesis and ask the data for
						answers ourselves, without the help of IT.”
						"When managing such a goal-oriented workforce
						and having clients who demand a
						strong performance, you can talk about
						things for a while but at the end of the day it
						is about the numbers. Either you deliver or
						not. If you don’t have the data and don’t
						manage according to them it can kill you; if
						you do, it can really accelerate your growth!"</p>

					<p>We’ve worked so many hours for this client,has their invoice been issued yet?</p>

				<div class="desc-half-list">
					<p>"The most important KPI we track are work hours
						which translate into future profits. Next to that
						we track revenue from invoice, back to the segments
						that it was billed for, the size of the company,
						or the cost if it was direct or indirect,
						and who issued it. We also use the system as a type
						of tracker and guard keeper. We look for answers to
						questions like: “We’ve worked so many hours
						for this client, has their invoice been issued yet?” .
						Then  we track the customer’s KPIs all the way
						from AdWords and  Analytics, as well as billing." </p>

					<p>"According to my estimate we have so far saved
						more than 10% of each employees time. Most of the
						time we have saved by just the simple fact that
						all the data is tracked together. Then we have to
						log into different systems, trying to bind that
						data together . Now we see the whole flow of the
						work together. I would say that it is more than
						two people per month that we’ve saved costs for.
						Once we get the automatic reports started for
						our clients, I estimate that we will take this
						number of cost savings up to three to four people."</p>
