							<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;It was an enlightening moment - looking at the data we suddenly realised that generating a 50% upsell to 42% of our customer base it’s just as easy as suggesting to buy a rubber or a sharpener with the pencil our customer already has in it’s hand.</p>

						<h1>More about project</h1>
					<div class="desc-half-list">
						<p>McPen has started to go Data Driven Business route one year ago. With the help of Keboola partner Ascoria they have created a very retail focused solution that take the data from different sources like POS, Frames, etc. and turned it into a full fledge operational management system that is now used in all levels of McPen management from CEO down to floor workers who run their stationary goods shops.


						</p>

							<p>
							MacPen’s strategy was to generate upsells on the customers that spend the most money in the shop. A single glance on the sales data shows that while the biggest income comes from customers buying totals between 200 and 500 CZK, the biggest potential for upsell lies in the category of customers that buys totals up to 50 CZK (around 2 USD) which makes up to 42% of all customers of Mc Pen.

							<p>Without extensive system analytical knowledge or heavy support from IT,

							These dashboards are now in used every day across the organization and serve
							as the basis for </p>
							<p>

								Due to his actions, this system has received widespread support,
