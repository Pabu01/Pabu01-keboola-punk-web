						<h1>About the project</h1>
					<div class="desc-half-list">
						<p>McPen has started to go Data Driven Business route one year ago. With the help of Keboola partner Ascoria they have created a very retail focused solution that take the data from different sources like POS, Frames, etc. and turned it into a full fledge operational management system that is now used in all levels of McPen management from CEO down to floor workers who run their stationary goods shops.


						</p>

							<p>
							MacPen’s strategy was to generate upsells on the customers that spend the most money in the shop. A single glance on the sales data shows that while the biggest income comes from customers buying totals between 200 and 500 CZK, the biggest potential for upsell lies in the category of customers that buys totals up to 50 CZK (around 2 USD) which makes up to 42% of all customers of Mc Pen.

						<h1>Hero Story</h1>
						<div class="desc-half-list">
							<p>McPen's CEO and our partner company Ascoria were  able to put the whole project
								together within just couple of months. Starting from scratch, being lean and adding
								new and new features as they were tested and proven their benefit to the organisation.
								All of this without a need for a single developer envolved.

								</p>
							<p>
							Mr. Petr, CEO of McPen, recognized the need for complex change management as he wanted
							to envolve not only top management and trained data scientist, but his goal was a company wide
							deployment and use of the data as the fundamental layer for everyday decisions done righ on the floor
							and not in some glass office in HQ. He slowly envolved all managarial layers of the organization,
							learning how to use data for daily operations first himself.
